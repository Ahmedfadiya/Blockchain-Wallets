## Module_19_Challenge


This is a startup that is building a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As Fintech Finder’s lead developer, I am tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable your customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

## Purpose
* The purpose of this application is for the customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals.

## Steps
• Import Ethereum Transaction Functions into the Fintech Finder Application
• Sign and Execute a Payment Transaction
• Inspect the Transaction
